# View Tasks

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. On the home page, scroll down to the "Tasks" section.
2. Use the filter input to search for tasks based on specific criteria.
   - Enter a keyword in the filter box.
   - Select the field you want to filter by (e.g., Description, Project, Status, Allocated To).
3. Click on the table headers to sort tasks by that column.
   - Clicking the same header again will toggle the sort direction between ascending and descending.
4. Review your tasks displayed in the spreadsheet-style list.
   - The **Allocated To** column shows who the task has been allocated to, if applicable.

Note: The task list is responsive and easy to read, with important information clearly displayed.
